1. Install the dependencies with 'pip install scikit-learn scipy numpy matplotlib'
2. To see the plot for q2e, run 'python3 q2.py'
3. To see the plot for q4a (MNIST), uncomment the code between lines 71-77 and comment out the code between lines 79-85 in q4.py, then run 'python3 q4.py'.
   To see the plot for q4b (SPAM), first go into the 'scripts' directory, comment out the code between lines 312-354 in featurize.py, and run 'python3 featurize.py'. Once the above is done, exit back into the 'hw1code' directory, then comment out the code between lines 71-77 and uncomment the code between lines 79-85 in q4.py, if the plot for q4a was generated first. Finally, run 'python3 q4.py'.
5. To see the plot for q5, run 'python3 q5.py'. The table will be printed out in the terminal.
6. To see the plot for q6, run 'python3 q6.py'. The table will be printed out in the terminal.
7. To generate the csv for q7a (MNIST), uncomment the code between lines 50-61 and comment out the code between lines 63-80 in q7.py, then run 'python3 q7.py'. The test predictions will be saved to 'kaggle_mnist.csv'.
   To generate the csv for q7b (SPAM), first go into the 'scripts' directory, uncomment the code between lines 312-354 in featurize.py, and run 'python3 featurize.py'. Once the above is done, exit back into the 'hw1code' directory, then comment out the code between lines 50-61 and uncomment the code between lines 63-85 in q4.py, if the csv for q7a was generated first. Finally, run 'python3 q7.py'. The test predictions will be saved to 'kaggle_spam.csv'.
